## üìå Project Description

**InspoNest** is a web-based visual bookmarking and inspiration platform modeled after Pinterest, designed specifically for college students and young creatives. Whether you're seeking ideas for fashion, interior design, art, food, or lifestyle, InspoNest helps you collect, organize, and revisit visual content in a meaningful way.

Our primary users are students or early-career creatives who want to:
- Curate aesthetic posts
- Save and categorize inspiring content
- Discover new trends through a visually engaging platform

This app fills a gap for users who are overwhelmed by the volume of content online and want a clean, collaborative, and community-driven digital space. InspoNest helps them create cohesive, aesthetic collections they can return to for creativity and motivation.

As developers, we‚Äôre excited about this project because it:
- Combines frontend and backend challenges
- Requires thoughtful UI/UX design
- Encourages creative expression and visual storytelling
